# Limitations

The following PostgreSQL versions are currently supported:

* 10
* 9.6
* 9.5
* 9.4

Other versions are usable but not fully integrated in all components.
This might make additional manual tuning necessary.

All official supported versions are installable via the configured *apt.postgresql.org* repository.
Please see <https://apt.postgresql.org/> for more information.
We intend to support newer versions of PostgreSQL as soon as they are released.
