# Limitations

The following PostgreSQL versions are currently supported:

* 11
* 10
* 9.6
* 9.5
* 9.4

Other versions are usable but not fully integrated in all components.
This might make additional manual tuning necessary.

Packages for all PostgreSQL versions are installable via the *apt.postgresql.org* repository on Debian/Ubuntu,
and *yum.postgresql.org* on RedHat/CentOS.
Please see <https://apt.postgresql.org/> for more information.
