== CentOS/RHEL 7 package installation instructions ==

IMPORTANT: The current packages are in an early *BETA* stage, use with care.

* SELinux compatibility

CentOS 7 normally enforces SELinux policy rules. However, the
cockpit-selinux packages from CentOS/extras are broken currently.
The same applies to the COPR testing repository on

   https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/cockpit/cockpit-preview/

but in some other way. Thus, elephant-shed currently only supports
operating on CentOS/RHEL systems with SELinux set to "permissive" (or
turned off).

elephant-shed depends on EPEL and PGDG software repositories. You
need to enable them first, before installing elephant-shed packages.
The following steps should be performed as root (if not noted otherwise).

* EPEL

   $ yum install epel-release

* PGDG

Repository packages can be retrieved from

   https://yum.postgresql.org/repopackages.php

Choose either CentOS or RHEL repository packages, depending on your
target platform. Here for example PostgreSQL 10 repository packages for CentOS 7:

   $ yum install https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/10/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-centos10-10-2.noarch.rpm

* elephant-shed package repository

Install the repository package from https://packages.credativ.com:

   $ yum install https://packages.credativ.com/public/postgresql/yum/credativ-repo-1-1.noarch.rpm

* RPM installation steps

Update the yum cache

   $ yum makecache

Install elephant-shed

There are currently unsigned packages in the repository, thus you need to pass
--nogpgcheck to yum, otherwise it will complain about unsigned packages. This is going
to be fixed asap.

   $ yum -install --nogpgcheck elephant-shed
